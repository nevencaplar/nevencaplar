## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher at [Dirac (Institute for Data-intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology)](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu), University of Washington! I work on commissioning the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org) ðŸ”­  + and the commissioning of [LINCC-Frameworks (LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing)](https://lsstdiscoveryalliance.org/programs/lincc-frameworks/). 

### LINCC-Frameworks
LINCC - Frameworks aims to ðŸŒ± grow and  develop ðŸŒ± software for the analysis of the large amounts of data expected from LSST.

I am currently guiding the development of ðŸŒ± [TAPE](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/lsstseries) ðŸŒ± ; the code for efficient and scalable analysis of :hourglass_flowing_sand: time-domain data :hourglass_flowing_sand:.  
We plan to merge TAPE into ðŸŒ± [LSDB](https://github.com/astronomy-commons/lsdb) ðŸŒ± ; the general package for efficient and scalable :dart: cross-matching :dart: & analysis of astronomy catalogs. This is going to be achived via a new [nested package](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/nested-pandas). 

The main goal of these efforts is to enable science in the LSST era. Find the demo we made for a conference in May 2024 [here](https://github.com/dirac-institute/ZTF_FG_BoyajianSearch/blob/main/analysis/notebooks/tda-uw-demo/hrdiagram-timeseries-ztf-gaia.ipynb).

### LSST commissioning

I am a member of the science verification team. For instance, I have been working on the [analysis of difference imagining pipeline using the data from the auxiliary telescope](https://github.com/lsst-sitcom/notebooks_dia/blob/main/use_custom_APDB_for_auxtel.ipynb). See [a notebook prepared for a May 2024 sprint for the verification of the observation rehersal data](https://github.com/lsst-sitcom/notebooks_dia/blob/main/Op_rehs_3_dia_truth_sprint_May13_2024.ipynb).

### Previous work
I worked on commissioning the [Prime Focus Spectrograph](https://pfs.ipmu.jp) at Subaru telescope ðŸ”­ as part of the data reduction pipeline team - focusing on [2D Point spread function modeling](https://github.com/Subaru-PFS/dev_2ddrp/tree/master/2d_PSF_code).

### Science
My scientific work focuses on variability, AGN, and star-formation physics [(papers here)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KrPhRDoAAAAJ).
