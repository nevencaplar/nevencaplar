### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher at [Dirac (Institute for Data-intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology)](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu), University of Washington! I work on the commissioning of [LSST](https://www.lsst.org) ðŸ”­  + and commissioning of [LINCC (LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing)](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/lincc/frameworks). 

We are currently ðŸŒ± [growing the code](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/lsstseries) ðŸŒ±  for efficent and scalable analysis of large amount of :hourglass_flowing_sand: time-domain data :hourglass_flowing_sand: expected from LSST. See this project and others at our [wiki](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/docs/wiki).

Previously, I worked for the [Prime Focus Spectrograph](https://pfs.ipmu.jp) at Subaru telescope ðŸ”­ as part of the data reduction pipeline team - focusing on [2D Point spread function modelling](https://github.com/Subaru-PFS/dev_2ddrp/tree/master/2d_PSF_code).

My scientifc work focuses on variability, AGN and star-formation pyhsics.
