## Hi there 👋

I'm a research scientist/engineer for [LINCC-Frameworks (LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing)](https://lsstdiscoveryalliance.org/programs/lincc-frameworks/). I am based at [DiRAC Institute](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu), University of Washington.

### LINCC-Frameworks
LINCC - Frameworks aims to 🌱 grow and  develop 🌱 software for the analysis of the large amounts of data expected from upcoming surveys, such as [LSST](https://www.lsst.org), [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org), [Roman](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov), and [Schmidt Observatory System](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/schmidt-observatory-system/).

I am currently guiding the development ⚙️[LSDB](https://github.com/astronomy-commons/lsdb) ⚙️; the python package for efficient and scalable :hammer: analysis :hammer: and  :dart: cross-matching :dart: of astronomy catalogs. We are particulary excited about how we use ⚙️[nested package](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/nested-pandas)⚙️ to enable time-domain analysis. 

Find [here the demo we made for the review of the project in February 2025](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/midpoint-review/blob/main/docs/notebooks/lsdb/Notebook_LSDB_HATS.ipynb). And check out [lsdb.io](https://lsdb.io).

### Previous work
#### Commissioning of Rubin Observatory
I was a member of the science verification team for construction of Rubin Observatory 🔭. I was working on the [analysis of difference imagining pipeline using the data from the Rubin commissioning](https://github.com/lsst-sitcom/notebooks_dia). See [a notebook prepared for a May 2024 sprint for the verification of the observation rehersal data](https://github.com/lsst-sitcom/notebooks_dia/blob/main/OR3/Op_rehs_3_dia_truth_sprint_May13_2024.ipynb).

#### Commissioning of Prime Focus Spectrograph
I worked on commissioning the [Prime Focus Spectrograph](https://pfs.ipmu.jp) at Subaru telescope 🔭 as part of the data reduction pipeline team - focusing on [2D Point spread function modeling](https://github.com/Subaru-PFS/dev_2ddrp/tree/master/2d_PSF_code).

### Science
My scientific work focuses on variability, AGN, and star-formation physics [(papers here)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KrPhRDoAAAAJ).
