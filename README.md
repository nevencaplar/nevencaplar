## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher at [Dirac (Institute for Data-intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology)](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu), University of Washington! I am part of [LINCC-Frameworks (LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing)](https://lsstdiscoveryalliance.org/programs/lincc-frameworks/) and the commissioning of [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org) ðŸ”­. 

### LINCC-Frameworks
LINCC - Frameworks aims to ðŸŒ± grow and  develop ðŸŒ± software for the analysis of the large amounts of data expected from LSST.

I am currently guiding the development ðŸŒ± [LSDB](https://github.com/astronomy-commons/lsdb) ðŸŒ± ; the python package for efficient and scalable :hammer: analysis :hammer: and  :dart: cross-matching :dart: of astronomy catalogs. We are particulary excited about how we use ðŸŒ± [nested package](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/nested-pandas) ðŸŒ± to enable time-domain analysis. 

The main goal of these efforts is to enable science in the LSST era. Find [here the demo we made for the review of the project in February 2025](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/midpoint-review/blob/main/docs/notebooks/lsdb/Notebook_LSDB_HATS.ipynb). And check out [lsdb.io](lsdb.io)!

### LSST commissioning

I am a member of the science verification team. I am working on the [analysis of difference imagining pipeline using the data from the Rubin commissioning](https://github.com/lsst-sitcom/notebooks_dia). See [a notebook prepared for a May 2024 sprint for the verification of the observation rehersal data](https://github.com/lsst-sitcom/notebooks_dia/blob/main/OR3/Op_rehs_3_dia_truth_sprint_May13_2024.ipynb).

### Previous work
I worked on commissioning the [Prime Focus Spectrograph](https://pfs.ipmu.jp) at Subaru telescope ðŸ”­ as part of the data reduction pipeline team - focusing on [2D Point spread function modeling](https://github.com/Subaru-PFS/dev_2ddrp/tree/master/2d_PSF_code).

### Science
My scientific work focuses on variability, AGN, and star-formation physics [(papers here)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KrPhRDoAAAAJ).
